At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song, oh yeah
At last, the skies above me are blue
My heart was wrapped iup cloer the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A thrill I've never known, oh yeah
You smiled, you smiled oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are in mine at last
